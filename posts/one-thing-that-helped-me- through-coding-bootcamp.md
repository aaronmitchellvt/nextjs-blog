Learning how to code is a lot like riding a roller coaster. There are ups and downs, 
highs and lows. At times it coding feels exhilarating, and when you successfully build 
that feature or fix a tricky bug, you are a badass coding ninja. Other times you feel:
clueless, like an imposter, overwhelmed, frustrated, etc.

In this post I'm going to talk about one easy, but effective technique I use when my coding
roller coaster is going downwards. 

## Understand learning can be uncomfortable ##

When you were a young child learning how to ride a bike you may remember it being
a little scary. This is pretty understandable, you can easily fall/ lose balance/
 crash and get physically hurt! 

Although we don't fear busting our knee while learning a new concept, the fear of 
not being able to learn a new skill is still very real. After all this could mean: 
I may fail an assessment, I may not be employable, I am wasting my time and money, I'm just an imposter, etc.

## Don't fixate on everything you don't know ##
When learning how to code it is very easy to fixate on everything that we **don't** know. The world of software is endlessly vast and always changing. We see the crazy list of requirements on job applications, or all endless suggestions of new technologies you **NEED** to learn. 


## Don't shift a learning Win into a Loss ##
Learning something new is obviously a positive thing right? Well yeah, but sometimes our brain can do some mental gymnastics to turn that win into a loss. Sometimes after putting all of that effort into learning a new framework, language, etc then feeling proud and accomplished, we feel unaccomplished and incompetent because it still doesn't feel like enough. This feeling will negatively reinforce the action of learning. 

Don't do this! Enough is not definable. Let your learning bring you joy and satisfaction. 


## Reflect on everything you have learned ##
Be proud of how far you come! Take a moment to think of a times where you were introduced to something new. Remember the feeling of "this is too complicated" or "there's no way I can learn this". Take a moment to realize how many times you have proved those feelings wrong. 


## Summary ##

**In conclusion**


- Understand and validate that learning can be scary and uncomfortable.
- Acknowledge it is wonderful that you are learning something new.
- Think of what you have learned and how far you've come, instead of fixating on everything you don't know.
- Take a moment to give yourself a pat on the back when you learn something new. Remember how difficult and overwhelming it was at first.
